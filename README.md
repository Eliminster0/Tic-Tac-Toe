Design Philosophy
---
Tic Tac Toe is an awful game, and giving it a Star Wars theme makes it mildy better.

Compiling and Running the Game
---
You can either clone the project from GitHub and open it in your preferred Android IDE, or you can download/install the [APK][4] to your device.

Summary
---
This application is very simple. It uses the native button class for the UI at the start screen, and the AI is not any form of intelligence. The application is a single thread, 2D, turned based game, but it is Star Wars themed!
